    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there, my name is Michael. I’m a Mathematics major from the University of Virginia with a passion for data analysis. I’ve had the pleasure of working with many different kinds of math and love to find ways to apply that to the real world. I’m especially interested in the fields of topology and geometry, with a specific interest in knot theory. I’m a believer in lifelong learning, and as such this website is just as much a learning experiment for me as it is a way for me to share my love for math with the world.</p>
    <p>On the side I’m a rower. I got my start at Briar Woods High School in Ashburn, Virginia where I rowed for 4 years. I continued my journey to the University of Virginia and loved every moment of it. From competing at national championships and races all across the country to overseas regattas in Switzerland and England, there is no place that I’m happier than when I’m on the water. I currently reside in Washington, D.C. and am a member of Potomac Boat Club.</p>
    <p>This website is best viewed on a desktop, but I'm working on improving the mobile experience.</p>
